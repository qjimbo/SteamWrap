# SteamWrap
SteamWrap is a utility for launching alternative game versions from Steam. It works by configuring Steam to launch SteamWrap instead of the game exe. By default SteamWrap will launch the default game as normal, but with an additional argument it will instead launch an alternative exe, which is typically an older version of a game. The benefit of this is each child process preserves the Steam authentication, allowing you to run old versions without having to modify them to run outside of steam.

## Features

- Automatically configures Steam LaunchOptions for games to ```SteamWrap.exe %command%``` to allow SteamWrap to redirect to alternative versions 
- Create desktop and Steam shortcuts for alternative game versions
- Launch games through Steam while redirecting to different executables
- When no arguments given, will launch the original version of the game transparently

## Usage
SteamWrap <game-id> [command] [arguments]

### Commands
1. Enable SteamWrap - specify which game by steam game id and it will set launchoptions to run SteamWrap when the game is started.
   ```
   SteamWrap <game-id> configure
3. Create shortcuts:
   ```
   SteamWrap <game-id> shortcut <type> <exe-path> <shortcut-name> <icon-path>
   ```
   Types: desktop, steam, both

4. Shutdown Steam:
   ```
   SteamWrap shutdown-steam
   ```

### Examples
